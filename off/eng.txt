How would you feel about living in a rock just like prehistoric people did?
Believe or not, that's exactly where some people in Cappadocia in Turkey live.

Over millions of years, nature created rocks in the area that look like upside-down
ice cream cones. Centuries ago, people carved caves in these rocks to make homes.

Today, people visit the area to admire one of the stangest landscapes in the world.
Some say that it is like the surface of the moon. The locals enjoy living in the 'fairy chimneys', as they call them, because they are cool in the hot summers and warm in the cold winters. The caves area very cosy. They have small rooms with fireplaces and courtyards where people can relax and chat together. This really is a fairy-tale place!
